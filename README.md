# About Me
  I firmly believe being a software developer provides tremendous opportunities to bring a positive impact to society and the world as a whole. My previous experience revolves around human services, counseling patients with SUD (substance use disorders), and directing SUD treatment facilities. While my passion and drive to help others will never change, I have noticed a fracture in services as wells as an inability to reach large groups of people at once. While transitioning over into technology and the development of software/applications, I see a space and environment where I can contribute to bridging such gap.

The hunger and drive I feel in this field is next to none. While the field of technology continues to grow and expand, I find myself immersed in a field with vast opportunities. These opportunities include continued lifelong learning/growth as well as a multitude of opportunities to contribute to change on a large scale.

I am dedicated to pivoting the skills I have learned in human services over into the field of technology. Problem solving under high levels of stress, as well as with extremely high stakes, is a skill that has taken years to cultivate. I believe this, as well as the ability to manage, interact, include and provide for people from all walks of life are all skills that I plan to take with me on this lifelong journey.
